## 🚀 Quick Start (60 seconds)

### For Flux / Chroma (Modern Models)

1. Load your Flux/Chroma checkpoint
2. Add the **🎨 Regional Prompter (Flux/Chroma - Easy!)** node
3. Connect CLIP from your checkpoint to the node
4. Type in the background prompt: `"photo of a city street"`
5. Draw a box on the canvas where you want something specific
6. Type in Region 1 prompt: `"red sports car"`
7. Draw another box for something else
8. Type in Region 2 prompt: `"street vendor"`
9. Connect the conditioning output to your sampler
10. Generate! 🎉

**That's it!** No external nodes, no complex wiring. Just prompts and boxes.

### For SDXL / Stable Diffusion

Same steps, but use **🎨 Regional Prompter (SD/SDXL - Easy!)** instead.

## ✨ Why Use This?

**Without Regional Conditioning:**
- "A tiger and a berry bush in front of mountains"
- → AI puts them wherever it wants (usually random placement)

**With Regional Conditioning:**
- Background: "Mountains"
- Box 1 (left side): "Tiger"
- Box 2 (right side): "Berry bush"
- → AI puts them **exactly where you drew the boxes**

**Perfect for:**
- Character positioning in scenes
- Multi-subject compositions
- Product photography layouts
- Architectural visualization
- Comic/storyboard panels

## 💡 How to Use (Detailed)

### Understanding the Canvas

When you add a Regional Prompter node, you'll see:
- **A canvas** (black rectangle) - This is your drawing area
- **Prompt boxes** (text inputs) - Background + up to 4 regions
- **Drawing controls** (below canvas) - Position and size your boxes

### Drawing Your First Region

1. **Start with background prompt:**
   - Type: `"photo of a sunny beach"`
   - This applies to the whole image

2. **Add your first region:**
   - In Region 1 prompt, type: `"woman in red dress"`
   - Below the canvas, find the controls for Region 1
   - Set: `x=100, y=200, width=300, height=400`
   - You'll see a colored box appear on the canvas!

3. **Adjust the box visually:**
   - Change the `index` dropdown to select which region to edit
   - Each region gets a unique color
   - The 64px grid helps you align precisely

4. **Add more regions:**
   - Type in Region 2 prompt: `"beach umbrella"`
   - Adjust x/y/width/height to position it
   - Repeat for up to 4 regions total

5. **Generate!**
   - Connect to your sampler and generate
   - Each prompt appears exactly where you drew it

### Tips for Best Results

#### For Flux Users:
- ✅ **Enable "Flux Optimize"** (it's on by default) - This uses special mask strength (0.8) that works better than full strength
- ✅ **Use 3-4 regions maximum** - More regions = quality degradation
- ✅ **Increase CFG to 5-7** - Flux needs higher guidance for regional control
- ✅ **Draw larger boxes** - Bigger regions = better control

#### For SDXL Users:
- ✅ **Align to 64px grid** - Matches latent space boundaries
- ✅ **No region limit** - Use as many as you need
- ✅ **Normal CFG values** - 7-9 works great

#### General Tips:
- **Overlapping regions** are processed in order (Region 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
- **Strength slider** (0.0-10.0) controls region influence:
  - `1.0` = Normal (default)
  - `0.5` = Subtle hint
  - `2.0+` = Strong emphasis
  - `0.0` = Effectively disabled
- **Leave prompts empty** to disable unused regions
- **Fullscreen regions** (x=0, y=0, width=canvas, height=canvas) act as background

## 📚 All Available Nodes

### Enhanced (Easy Mode) - RECOMMENDED

#### 🎨 Regional Prompter (SD/SDXL - Easy!)
**Perfect for Stable Diffusion and SDXL**

**Inputs:**
- `clip` - CLIP model from your checkpoint
- `background_prompt` - Overall scene description (multiline text)
- `region1_prompt` through `region4_prompt` - What appears in each box (optional)

**Outputs:**
- `conditioning` - Connect to your sampler
- `width`, `height` - Canvas dimensions (for reference)

**How it works:** Type prompts directly, draw boxes, done! The node handles all CLIP encoding internally.

---

#### 🎨 Regional Prompter (Flux/Chroma - Easy!)
**Perfect for Flux, Chroma, and SD3**

**Inputs:**
- `clip` - CLIP model from your checkpoint *(from Load Checkpoint node)*
- `width`, `height` - Output image dimensions *(just numbers - no latent needed!)*
- `background_prompt` - Overall scene description (multiline text)
- `region1_prompt` through `region4_prompt` - What appears in each box (optional)
- `soften_masks` - Soften region edges (default: ON - RECOMMENDED!)

**Outputs:**
- `conditioning` - Connect to your KSampler's positive conditioning input

**How the Workflow Connects:**
```
Load Checkpoint → CLIP
                   ↓
    Regional Prompter (Flux/Chroma)
    (Set width/height here, e.g., 1024x1024)
                   ↓
              conditioning
                   ↓
            KSampler (positive input)
```

**💡 About "Soften Masks" (IMPORTANT!):**
- ✅ **KEEP ON (default):** Softer region edges, better blending (0.8 strength + gentle feather)
- ❌ **Turn OFF only if:** You want sharp, harsh region boundaries (1.0 strength, no feather)
- **Why it's better:** Research shows softer masks (0.8) produce better results than full-strength (1.0) for Flux
- **For Chroma/SD3:** Try it ON first (default), disable only if you prefer sharper edges
- **What feathering does:** Gentle edge blending (5-8 pixels) to avoid harsh boundaries - you can disable by turning this toggle OFF

### Advanced Nodes (For Power Users)

#### Multi Area Conditioning (SD/SDXL - Advanced)
Area-based conditioning for traditional Stable Diffusion models. Requires external CLIP Text Encode nodes.

**Inputs:**
- `conditioning0` - Base/background conditioning (connect CLIPTextEncode here)
- `conditioning1`, `conditioning2`, etc. - Regional conditioning (add more via right-click menu)

**Outputs:**
- `conditioning` - Combined regional conditioning
- `resolutionX`, `resolutionY` - Canvas dimensions

**Right-Click Menu:**
- Insert input above/below current
- Swap with input above/below
- Remove currently selected input
- Remove all unconnected inputs

---

#### Multi Area Conditioning (Flux/Chroma - Advanced)
Mask-based conditioning for modern models. Requires external CLIP Text Encode nodes.

**Inputs:**
- `conditioning0` - Base/background conditioning
- `conditioning1`, `conditioning2`, etc. - Regional conditioning
- `width`, `height` - Output dimensions
- `mask_strength` - Mask intensity (0.7-0.85 recommended for Flux, 1.0 for others)

**Output:**
- `conditioning` - Combined mask-based conditioning

**How it works:** Boxes are automatically converted to binary masks. You draw visually, the node handles mask generation.

---

### Utility Nodes

#### Conditioning Upscale
Scale conditioning areas by a multiplier - perfect for hi-res fix workflows.

**Example:** 512x512 regions × scalar=2 → 1024x1024 regions

---

#### Conditioning Stretch
Resize conditioning to fit new dimensions - more flexible than upscale.

**Example:** Transform regions from 512x512 to 1024x768 (proportional scaling)

---

#### Multi Latent Composite (Visual)
Visual interface for compositing multiple latents with positioning and feathering.

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic bounds checking and clipping
- ✅ Channel compatibility validation
- ✅ Smart feathering with gradient masks
- ✅ Detailed warnings and info messages

---

## 🔧 Advanced Techniques

### Fullscreen/Background Conditioning
Set a region to cover the entire canvas (`x=0, y=0, width=canvas_width, height=canvas_height`) to make it fullscreen. This is perfect for background prompts that should influence the whole image.

### Grid Alignment
The 64px grid overlay helps you align regions to latent space boundaries (VAE works in 8x downscaled space, 64px = 8 latent pixels).

### Strength Control
Every region has a strength slider (0.0-10.0):
- **1.0** - Normal strength (default)
- **0.5** - Subtle influence (region blends more with background)
- **2.0+** - Strong influence (region dominates)
- **0.0** - Effectively disabled

### Overlapping Regions
Regions are processed in order. If boxes overlap:
- Background applies first (fullscreen)
- Region 1 applies on top
- Region 2 applies on top of Region 1
- And so on...

The last region "wins" in overlapping areas (for mask-based conditioning).

### Dynamic Sizing
**Important:** The canvas size can be different from your output size!

For example:
- Draw on a 512x512 canvas
- Generate at 1024x1024 output
- Regions automatically scale 2x

This makes it easy to design compositions at lower resolution, then generate at higher resolution.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Workflow metadata missing" error
**Cause:** ComfyUI hasn't saved your workflow yet
**Fix:** Save the workflow (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S), then reload the page

### Canvas doesn't show boxes I drew
**Cause:** Workflow not saved, or coordinates are outside canvas
**Fix:**
1. Save and reload workflow
2. Check that x+width ≤ canvas width and y+height ≤ canvas height
3. Select the region using the `index` dropdown to see where it is

### Flux regions look harsh or over-defined
**Cause:** Flux Optimize is disabled, or using advanced node with mask_strength=1.0
**Fix:**
- Use the Easy node with Flux Optimize ON
- Or set mask_strength to 0.7-0.85 in the advanced node

### Too many regions = bad quality (Flux)
**Cause:** Flux struggles with more than 4 regions
**Fix:** Combine related elements into single regions, or use fewer boxes

### Region has no effect
**Cause:** Prompt is empty, strength is 0.0, or box is too small
**Fix:**
1. Make sure the region prompt has text
2. Check strength slider is at least 0.5
3. Make boxes at least 64x64 pixels

## 📸 Complete Workflow Examples

### Easy Mode Workflow (RECOMMENDED)
The simplest possible setup - only 3 nodes needed!

```
Load Checkpoint
    ├─→ CLIP ─→ Regional Prompter (Flux/Chroma - Easy!)
    │             ├─ Set width: 1024
    │             ├─ Set height: 1024
    │             ├─ background_prompt: "your scene description"
    │             ├─ region1_prompt: "what goes in box 1"
    │             ├─ region2_prompt: "what goes in box 2"
    │             └─ soften_masks: ✅ ON (recommended!)
    │
    ├─→ MODEL ──┐
    └─→ VAE ───┐│
               ││
    Regional Prompter → conditioning
               ││
               ↓↓
            KSampler
         (positive: conditioning from Regional Prompter)
         (negative: empty or your negative prompt)
         (model: from Load Checkpoint)
         (latent: Empty Latent Image at matching size)
               ↓
          VAE Decode
               ↓
          Save Image
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Width/height in the Regional Prompter should match your Empty Latent Image size
- ✅ No latent input needed on the Regional Prompter - it just needs the numbers!
- ✅ The node outputs CONDITIONING, not an image - connect to KSampler's positive input
- ✅ Keep "Soften Masks" ON for better results (especially Flux)

### Advanced Mode Workflow (For Power Users)
When you need shared CLIP encodings or more control:

```
Load Checkpoint → CLIP → CLIPTextEncode (background)
                            ↓
                     CLIPTextEncode (region 1)
                            ↓
                     CLIPTextEncode (region 2)
                            ↓
            Multi Area Conditioning (collects all)
                            ↓
                   conditioning output
                            ↓
                        KSampler → VAE Decode → Save Image
```

**When to use Advanced Mode:**
- You want to share CLIP encodings across multiple nodes
- You need manual control over mask strength per region
- You're doing complex prompt engineering with multiple text encode nodes
